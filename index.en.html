	  <h2>About this page</h2>

	  <p>
	    Remember that the law is written by people in power, whose
	    interests usually are opposite of yours. The police exist
	    to protect them, not you.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    This app is published by Allt åt Alla with much of it's
	    contents borrowed from older bust cards by
	    Vänsterjuristerna.

	  <h2>General Advice</h2>

	  <p>
	    Bring some money and a watch to protests where you risk
	    getting arrested. Leave address books at home. Set a
	    PIN-code on your phone and remember that if you take
	    pictures, they can be used to identify your friends.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    You don't have to answer any questions asked by the
	    police. Let them prove your guilt and always deny all
	    accusations. In particular, don't tell the police who's "in
	    charge" of a protest, they could be charged with
	    incitement.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Don't be surprised if the police lie or act outside of
	    their authority. They usually do. Try to record abuse and
	    the identity of police officers.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Disorderly Conduct</h2>

	  <p>
	    The Swedish constitution grants you the right to protest
	    and excise free speech. These rights also apply to counter
	    protests. It the situation is, or is about to become,
	    disorderly, the police can intervene in the following ways:
	  </p>

	  <h3>Dismiss</h3>

	  <p>
	    The police orders you to leave a place or won't let you
	    enter some location (PL13).
	  </p>

	  <h3>Remove</h3>

	  <p>
	    The police can move you against your will, a short distance
	    and for a short time. They may search you to look for
	    weapons and to try to identify you (PL13).
	  </p>

	  <h3>Mass removal</h3>

	  <p>
	    If a crowd acts disorderly, the police may conduct an
	    "extended removal" (PL13c). The police will then round you
	    up, put you on a buss and drive you a significant
	    distance. The police may not hold you for more than 2
	    hours.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Detain</h3>

	  <p>
	    If the police thinks that dismissing you is not sufficient,
	    they can take you to a police station or to your home
	    (PL13). You have the right to know why you are being
	    removed (PL15). The police may hold you for at most 6
	    hours, but they shall release you directly after
	    questioning (PL16).
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h2>PL24 Area</h2>

	  <p>
	    The police may restrict access to an area and prevent
	    people from entering it or stipulate conditions for
	    entering the area. A common condition is that you must
	    identify yourself. The police can eg. declare a PL24 area
	    around a protest they think might be attacked.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If you try to enter a PL24 area the police can remove
	    you. Your action might also be criminal (failure to comply
	    with the police).
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h2>Covering your face</h2>

	  <p>
	    In Sweden you are generally allowed to cover your face to
	    prevent being identified. However, if a protest or crowd
	    acts disorderly, or is about to start acting disorderly,
	    you are no longer allowed to cover your face. The police
	    must inform the crowd of this new condition. Simply
	    carrying around stuff to cover your face with is never
	    illegal.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h2>Arrest &amp; Remand</h2>

	  <p>
	    If you are suspected of a crime that can result in 6 months
	    jail time or more, you have the right to a public
	    attorney. Ask for it straight away.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If you are held for questioning the police must release you
	    after 6 hours. If you are suspected of a crime, they can
	    hold you for another 6 hours. If you are younger than 15,
	    the limits are 3 and 6 hours. After this period they must
	    arrest you or let you go.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    You can be remanded in custody ("anhållen") for at most 4
	    days, after this the police must release you or continue to
	    hold you as "häktad". There is no upper limit on how long
	    you can remain häktad.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h2>Questioning</h2>

	  <p>
	    The police questioning you can not lie, make promises,
	    threats or use force. You have the right to get food (also
	    vegetarian if requested) and reasonable periods of
	    rest. You have the right to bring a friend or relative as
	    an interrogation witness if it won't hurt the
	    investigation.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    You only have to state your name, your personal identity
	    number (if you have one) and place of residence. Always
	    answer "no comment" to any other questions to protect
	    yourself and your friends. If you don't show up for an
	    interrogation that you have been summoned to the police
	    might come to pick you up, but it's not a crime.
