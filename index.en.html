        	    <p>If you are suspected of a crime that can result in 6 months jail time or more, you have the right to a public attorney. Ask for it straight away.</p>
        		<p>If you are held for questioning the police must release you after 6 hours. If you are suspected of a crime, they can hold you for another 6 hours. If you are younger than 15, the limits are 3 and 6 hours. After this period they must arrest you or let you go.</p>
        		<p>You can be remanded in custody ("anhållen") for at most 4 days, after this the police must release you or continue to hold you as "häktad". There is no upper limit on how long you can remain häktad</p>
